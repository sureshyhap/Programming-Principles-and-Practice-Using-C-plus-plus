I would like to be a computer programmer because it pays enough for me to live and is a lot of fun at times. Also it can help first world countries in some way. - 34

My favorite activity is playing video games. They are directly software created by computer programmers on a team including artists, testers, etc. I would love to one day be able to make my own video game(s). - 36

Even if I don't become a video game programmer, the process of programming any type of software is fun because the process of logically translating your thoughts to code can be fulfilling especially when the code works (or finally works!) - 40
