I would be most interested in information serving. A quote from Wikipedia: "Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge." I think that is incredibly profound and important. Anyone will be able to learn anything they want because they have access to it. Also easily providing this information after a simple search query like with Google is very important and is a great gift to mankind. It will allow anyone to become whatever they want without the discrimninating differences in economic status, etc. Knowledge is very important for furthering our society into tomorrow, -107
