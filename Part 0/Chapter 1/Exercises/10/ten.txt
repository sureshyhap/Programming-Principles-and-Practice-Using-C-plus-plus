In terms of intelligence of the mind, I believe aritificial intelligence will be able to simulate it very well. It may even be better! Just look at those AI bots that beat some of the world's chess grandmasters at chess. They are capable of learning best moves from training on a large history of games. -55

In terms of emotional intelligence, I think it will be much more difficult for an AI to simulate. Emotions and feeling are rooted in the depth of our souls created by God. The only way man will be able to create such beings is with the permission and blessing of God. -51
